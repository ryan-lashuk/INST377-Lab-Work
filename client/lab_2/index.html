    <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

    <p>
        Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line of text.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Sometimes you want to <strong><em>do both</em></strong>.
    </p>
</div>


<div class = "section_3">
    <h2 class = "subtitle">Empty Elements</h2>

    <p>
        Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. <br>
        Neither can image tags, or hard lines. <br>
        Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.

            Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.
