<h1>Ryan Lashuk Lab 1: Intro to HTML</h1>

<h2>First, the basics.</h2>

You need the following to build your website.

<ul>
    <li>HTML and CSS</li>
    <li>Javascript</li>
    <li>Node.js</li>
</ul>

You should list your top 5 albums below.

<ol>
    <li>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy - Kanye West</li>
    <li>Birds In The Trap Sing McKnight - Travis Scott</li>
    <li>Heaven Or Hell - Don Toliver</li>
    <li>Donda - Kanye West</li>
    <li>Man On The Moon - Kid Cudi</li>
</ol>


<h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

<p>
    Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line of text.
</p>

<p>
    Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.
</p>

<p>
    Sometimes you want to <strong><em>do both</em></strong>.
</p>


<h2>Empty Elements</h2>

<p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. <br>
    Neither can image tags, or hard lines. <br>
    Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.

<h2>Images </h2>

<p>
    Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.
</p>


<img src = "./images/onigiri_1.png">
<img src = "./images/onigiri_2.png">
<img src = "./images/onigiri_3.png">
<img src = "./images/onigiri_4.png">
